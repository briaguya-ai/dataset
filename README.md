Pok√©mon JSON dataset for SuperEffective.gg based on Showdown's data.

It also includes a JavaScript HTTP client, data types and Zod schema validators.

## Dev Server

This project includes a development server, to serve the `data`
folder as a JSON API.

Optionally, it can also serve a directory of assets, such as 
images (e.g `../supereffective-assets/assets`).

You can configure the server using the environment variables
from the `.env.example` file.

To start the server, run `pnpm dev`, which will also rebuild
the JS dist files whenever you change the TS files.
